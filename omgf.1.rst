SYNOPSIS
========

omgf [-cfhinrvVwy] [--color[=WHEN]] [KEYWORD] [NAME]

DESCRIPTION
===========

**Oh My Git Flow**\ [1] (hereinafter referred as the 'OMGF') applies **git
flow branching model**\ [2] according to KEYWORD and NAME. Both parameters are
optional (see PARAMETERS below).

OMGF is an alternative to **git-flow cheatsheet**\ [3] command with following
improvements:

-  even simpler usage (no parameters are required),

-  push and pull all main branches,

-  pull request support,

-  validate and repair project to conform the model,

-  automatic **semantic version numbering**\ [4] (file VERSION),

-  version history update support (file CHANGELOG.md),

-  version history follows **Keep a CHANGELOG**\ [5] principle,

-  tips how to proceed with development on current state,

-  independent production branches support,

-  parallel hotfix branches support.

Basic OMGF feature list:

- creating and merging standard branches,

- creating standard tags.

BASIC FLOW EXAMPLES
===================

Set default options as alias
    -  ``alias gf="omgf --verbose --what-now"``

Initialize **OMGF**
    -  ``gf --init``

Bugfixing on dev...
    -  ``echo "bugfix 1" >> myfile``
    -  ``git add myfile``
    -  ``git commit -m "add bugfix 1"``

Create a feature
    -  ``gf``
    -  Confirm by typing ``YES`` (or hit Enter)

Developing a feature...
    -  ``echo "new feature code 1" >> myfile``
    -  ``git commit -am "insert myfeature function 1"``
    -  ``echo "new feature code 2" >> myfile``
    -  ``git commit -am "insert myfeature function 2"``

Merge feature
    -  ``gf``
    -  Confirm by typing ``YES`` (or hit Enter)
    -  Insert myfeature description into CHANGELOG.md

Bugfixing on dev...
    -  ``echo "bugfix 2" >> myfile``
    -  ``git commit -am "add bugfix 2"``

Create release
    -  ``gf release``
    -  Confirm by typing ``YES`` (or hit Enter)

Bugfixing on release...
    -  ``echo "release bugfix 1" >> myfile``
    -  ``git commit -am "add release bugfix 1"``
    -  ``gf``
    -  Confirm by typing ``YES`` (or hit Enter)
    -  ``echo "release bugfix 2" >> myfile``
    -  ``git commit -am "add release bugfix 2"``

Merge release
    -  ``gf release``
    -  Confirm by typing ``YES`` (or hit Enter)

Continue on branch dev...

ADVANCED EXAMPLES
=================

Assume YES by default as alias
    -  ``alias gf="omgf --verbose --yes"``

New feature from uncommitted changes
    -  ``echo "feature force" >> myfile``
    -  ``gf feature myfeature``
    -  ...will exit with code 4
    -  ``gf --force feature myfeature``
    -  ``git commit -am "add feature force"``

Hotfix master branch
    -  ``gf hotfix``
    -  ``echo "hotfix 1" >> myfile``
    -  ``git commit -am "add hotfix 1"``
    -  ``gf``
    -  Insert hotfix description into CHANGELOG.md

Merge conflicting feature
    -  ``gf myfeature``
    -  ...will exit with code 5
    -  Resolve conflict...
    -  ``gf``

Create release with new MAJOR version
    -  ``gf release``
    -  ``echo 1.0.0 > VERSION``
    -  ``git commit -am "increment major version"``

Restore **OMGF** model (after merge pull request - release to master)
    -  ``gf feature myfeature``
    -  ...will exit with code 3
    -  ``gf --conform feature myfeature``

Hotfix obsolete stable branch
    -  ``gf hotfix v0.0``
    -  ``echo "hotfix old" >> myfile``
    -  ``git add myfile``
    -  ``git commit -am "add old hotfix"``
    -  ``gf``

EXIT STATUS
===========

0
    No problems occurred.
1
    Generic error code.
2
    Parse or invalid option error.
3
    Git is not conform with the branching model, probably fixable with omgf.
4
