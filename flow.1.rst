Flow - manage git branching model


SYNOPSIS
========

flow [-cefhinrvVwy] [--color[=WHEN]] [--push] [--pull] [BRANCH]


DESCRIPTION
===========

Advance in a branching model according to the current branch or a branch specified with an argument. For most existing branches, the default action is release. If a given branch does not exist, Flow creates it as a feature or a hotfix depending on the current branch or a keyword (feature/hotfix).

Additionally, Flow handles version incrementing and maintains a changelog. Before proceeding, it verifies the current repository for branching model compliance and offers to correct any detected imperfections.

OPTIONS
=======

\-c, --conform
    Repair (initialize) project to be conform with git flow branching model and proceed.

\--color[=WHEN], --colour[=WHEN]
    Use markers to highlight command status; WHEN is 'always', 'never', or 'auto'. Empty WHEN sets color to 'always'. Default color value is 'auto'.

\-e, --auto-entry
    Do not show changelog editor and insert general entry instead about the current action.

\-f, --force
    Clear and restore uncommitted changes before proceeding using git stash.

\-h, --help
    Print help.

\-i, --init
    Same as 'conform', but also initialize git repository if not exists and do not proceed with any action.

\-n, --dry-run
    Do not run commands; only parse user options and arguments.

\--pull
    Pull all remote branches.

\--push
    Push all branches.

\-r, --request
    Instead of merging prepare current branch for pull request and push it to the origin.

\-v, --verbose
    Verbose mode.

\-V, --version
    Print version number.

\-w, --what-now
    Display what to do on current branch.

\-y, --yes
    Assume yes for all questions.


EXIT CODES
==========

0
    No problems occurred.
1
    Generic error code.
2
    Parse or invalid option error.
3
    Git is not conform with the branching model (fixable).
4
    Git is not conform with the branching model (unfixable).
5
    Git status is not empty AKA uncommitted changes.
6
    Nothing to do (e. g. empty merge).

FLOW EXAMPLE
============

1. Initialize the branching model on an empty folder::

    mkdir myflow
    cd myflow
    flow --init --yes

This creates a git repository with key branches and a tag. The default version number is ``0.0.0`` on all branches except for dev, where it is ``0.1.0``. The --yes option serves to skip prompting individual steps.

2. Create and release a feature::

    flow --yes feature
    touch a
    git add a
    git commit -m "Add file a"
    flow --yes --auto-entry

This creates a feature branch from dev and merges it back after changes are made. Without the --yes and the --auto-entry options, Flow prompts for a confirmation and a changelog entry respectively.

3. Fix some bugs on dev and release it::

    touch b
    git add b
    git commit -m "Add file b"
    flow --yes

This makes changes directly on development branch and releases it. No argument is necessary as releasing is the default action for most branches.

Notice the version number ``0.1.0`` from dev branch moves to the staging branch and gets incremented on dev to ``0.2.0``. The stable branch (main) is still ``0.0.0``. You can use the following set of commands to check it::

    git show dev:VERSION
    git show staging:VERSION
    git show main:VERSION

4. Fix some bugs on the staging branch and release::

    touch c
    git add c
    git commit -m "Add file c"
    flow --yes --conform

Ideally, every commit of the staging branch must be merged into dev. The script recognizes the unmerged state and fixes it using the --conform option while advancing with the release.

Note: The staging branch and both production branches ('main' and 'main-0') are now on the same commit. There is also a tag with the newly released version number. This may seem a little far fetched. It will make more sense over time as the project grows.

5. Hotfix the production::

    flow --yes hotfix
    touch d
    git add d
    git commit -m "Add file d"
    flow --yes --auto-entry

This increments the patch version and merges the hotfix to the main branch, creates a tag and advances all attached branches with it. To keep the model compliant, it also merges the main branch into dev.

Note: The git log graph may now look somewhat confusing. It will make much more sense during real development. If you want to see it, use the following command::

    git log --oneline --decorate --color --graph --all

Note: Check out the resulting changelog file if you want. It contains the added feature, hotfix, and all releases. The changelog on the development branch has additionally an 'unreleased' section::

    git show main:CHANGELOG.md
    git diff main:CHANGELOG.md dev:CHANGELOG.md
